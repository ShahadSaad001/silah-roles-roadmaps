**Silah Project â€“ Role-Based Learning Roadmaps**

The "silah-roles-roadmaps" Markdown file contains detailed learning roadmaps for the development team of **Silah**, our university graduation project. It was originally written with the intention that **only our team members** would read and use it to prepare for their roles (frontend and backend development). The content is beginner-friendly and includes project-specific tools, technologies, and best practices we plan to use during the development of Silah.

We decided to make this document public in case it might benefit other students, developers, or teams working on similar projects. If you're preparing for your own web app or graduation project, we hope this helps guide you too!

Feel free to fork, adapt, or use any parts that are useful for your team.
